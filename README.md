# Sprint 3 Project: Spots

## Description

Spots is a responsive interactive social media web application where users can add and remove photos and make minor adjustments to their profile. By following a Figma design, using modern HTML and CSS styles, the project delivers clean, responsive layout that looks good on all screen sizes and is easy to use.

**Intro**

The Spots project starts with a header that contains the logo and the name of the project. Then it features two main sections: a Profile Section and a Cards Section. The design follows the specifications outlined in Figma, and the layout is fully responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience across various devices. The footer is simple, aligned with the Figma design to provide copyright information.
